    "text": "Hi! Thank you for visiting my website!\nI am a sociologist and a demographer, and currently a Marie Skłodowska-Curie Fellow at the University of Oxford. Before this, I was a David E. Bell fellow at Harvard University’s Center for Population and Development Studies. I have a PhD in Demography and Sociology from the University of Pennsylvania, and an MA in Development Studies from the Indian Institute of Technology Madras.\nBroadly, my research focuses on methodological innovations to understand interrelations between health, environment, and social inequality. My research on these topics has appeared in leading journals such as Population and Development Review, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, and World Development.\nI was awarded a Civil Registration and Vital Statistics Fellowship by the International Union for the Scientific Study of Population, and the Dorothy Thomas Award for best graduate student paper by the Population Association of America in 2021."

    "text": "I have been living on and off in a district in Bihar this year. Shops owned by Muslims in this district often have India or National in their names. My friend Mahtab Alam had first this pointed out to me, several years ago. Here are some photos.\nइस साल कुछ महीने मैं बिहार के एक ज़िले में रह रहा हूँ। यहाँ जिन दुकानों के मालिक मुस्लिम हैं, उनके नाम में अक्सर इंडिया या नेशनल देखने को मिलता है। मेरे दोस्त महताब आलम ने पहली बार मुझे यह दिखाया था, कई साल पहले। यहाँ आप कुछ फोटो देख सकते हैं। इन दुकानों को देखते-देखते “तीजा तेरा रंग था मैं तो” गाना याद आता है।"
