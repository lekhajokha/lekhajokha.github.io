A related interest is improving the measurement of demographic and development outcomes in low- and middle-income countries. I was awarded a Civil Registration and Vital Statistics Fellowship by the International Union for the Scientific Study of Population, and the Dorothy Thomas Award for best graduate student paper by the Population Association of America in 2021. My research has been published in leading journals such as Population and Development Review, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, and World Development."
