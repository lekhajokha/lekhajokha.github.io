    "text": "Hi! Thank you for visiting my website!\nI am a sociologist and a demographer, and currently a Post-Doctoral Associate at NYU Abu Dhabi. Before this, I have had post-doctoral stints at the University of Oxford (as a Marie Skłodowska-Curie Fellow) and at Harvard University’s Center for Population and Development Studies (as a David E Bell Fellow). I earned a PhD in Demography and Sociology from the University of Pennsylvania, and an MA in Development Studies from the Indian Institute of Technology Madras.\nBroadly, my research focuses on methodological innovations to understand interrelations between health, environment, and social inequality. My research on these topics has appeared in leading journals such as Population and Development Review, Science Advances, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, and World Development.\nI was awarded a Civil Registration and Vital Statistics Fellowship by the International Union for the Scientific Study of Population, and the Dorothy Thomas Award for best graduate student paper by the Population Association of America in 2021."

    "text": "I have been living on and off in a district in Bihar this year. Shops owned by Muslims in this district often have India or National in their names. My friend Mahtab Alam had first this pointed out to me, several years ago. Here are some photos.\nइस साल कुछ महीने मैं बिहार के एक ज़िले में रह रहा हूँ। यहाँ जिन दुकानों के मालिक मुस्लिम हैं, उनके नाम में अक्सर इंडिया या नेशनल देखने को मिलता है। मेरे दोस्त महताब आलम ने पहली बार मुझे यह दिखाया था, कई साल पहले। यहाँ आप कुछ फोटो देख सकते हैं। इन दुकानों को देखते-देखते “तीजा तेरा रंग था मैं तो” गाना याद आता है।"

    "text": "Records of births, deaths, and people alive are some of the most important statistics that are collected and analysed by states and societies. In many developing countries, however, these records are deficient. These limitations constrain public policy, health responses, and scientific knowledge. The research project, titled “Measuring and Understanding Mortality, its Exposures, and its Determinants in developing countries” aims to improve the measurement and understanding of population health in low and middle-income countries. It focused on understandin data quality and improving scientific understanding of mortality levels and their determinants.\nResearch outputs supported by project include:\n\nGupta, Aashish, Payal Hathi, Murad Banaji, Prankur Gupta, Ridhi Kashyap, Vipul Paikra, Kanika Sharma, Anmol Somanchi, Nikkil Sudharsanan, and Sangita Vyas. “Large and unequal life expectancy declines during the COVID-19 pandemic in India in 2020.” Science Advances 10, no. 29 (2024): eadk2070.\nPolizzi, Antonino, Luyin Zhang, Sergey Timonin, Aashish Gupta, Jennifer Beam Dowd, David A.
