Hi! Thank you for visiting my website!

I am a sociologist and a demographer, and currently a Post-Doctoral Associate at NYU Abu Dhabi. Before this, I have had post-doctoral stints at the University of Oxford (as a Marie Sk≈Çodowska-Curie Fellow) and at Harvard University's Center for Population and Development Studies (as a David E Bell Fellow). I earned a PhD in Demography and Sociology from the University of Pennsylvania, and an MA in Development Studies from the Indian Institute of Technology Madras.

Broadly, my research focuses on methodological innovations to understand interrelations between health, environment, and social inequality. My research on these topics has appeared in leading journals such as *Population and Development Review*, *Science Advances, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences*, and *World Development*.

I was awarded a Civil Registration and Vital Statistics Fellowship by the International Union for the Scientific Study of Population, and the Dorothy Thomas Award for best graduate student paper by the Population Association of America in 2021.
