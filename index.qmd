# Hi!

Thank you for visiting my website!

{{< ai envelope >}}

I have a PhD in Demography and Sociology from the University of Pennsylvania.

My work has received support from the the Civil Registration and Vital Statistics Fellowship of the International Union for the Scientific Study of Population. As well as the Marie Sk≈Çodowska-Curie Fellowship (at Oxford University) of the European Commission. I was awarded the Dorothy Thomas Award by the Population Association of America in 2021. I am very grateful to these organizations.

Over the years, I have learnt a lot from comments, disagreements, and feedback. Please do feel free to write to me if you have any. Thank you!
