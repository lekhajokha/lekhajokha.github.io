Records of births, deaths, and people alive are some of the most important statistics that are collected and analysed by states and societies. In many developing countries, however, these records are deficient. These limitations constrain public policy, health responses, and scientific knowledge. The research project, titled "Measuring and Understanding Mortality, its Exposures, and its Determinants in developing countries" aims to improve the measurement and understanding of population health in low and middle-income countries. It focused on understandin data quality and improving scientific understanding of mortality levels and their determinants.

Research outputs supported by project include:
